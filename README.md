# ROBOT_ARM_implemntation-
connecting 5 servo motors with Potentiometer
Welcome to the ROBOT_ARM_implemntation- wiki!
 designing a robot arm by using 5 servo motors and we can control each of the motors with the Potentiometer.
the controller will send a PWM signal to the Arduino then by the Potentiometer we can rotate the motors by (90,-90) degrees 
we are using:
1-Arduino Uno
2-Potentiometer
3- servo motors
4-Arduino IDE
5-Servo motor library 
pin used: PWM: 8,9,10,11,12
for the Potentiometer: A1,A2,A3,A4,A5
